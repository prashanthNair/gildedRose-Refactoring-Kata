# gildedRose-Refactoring-Kata

This repo contains gildedRose-Refactoring-Kata code refactoring. 
As per the requirement, customer wants to scale their business into multiple categories and keep existing functionality. The masterpiece for this use case is to refactor the existing code base and implement the new approaches to enhance the application to adopt more categories.

# Main Tasks
This model illustrates the best suitable way to refactor code with a set of coding principles that every developer should follow while implementing an application or feature.

 # Key Implementations 

 This sampling approach to implementing clean and scalable code.
 
 This is implemented with the TDD approach and Considered SOLID, DRY and KISS principles 
  
 1. Redesigned the project structure to get more readability and separation.
 2. Re-written the updateQuality method with possible ways for adding new features
 3. Removed code duplication, repetition and hardcoding.
 4. Added more Object Oriented Programming concepts to align with Object Oriented Programming.
 5. Created factory class for simplifying the item based quality update ( Making Open Closed Principle available )
 6. Moved the test suite to another project to make it independent and make more separation also added more test cases for possible scenarios
 7. Added interface to bring possible dependency inversion principle
 8. Made sure that implementation is more readable
 
 # Getting Started
 This repo contains gildedRose repository. To get a local copy up and running follow below simple steps.

 # Prerequisites

   .Net Core and Visual Studio 2017 or higher
   
 # Clone
 clone the repository https://github.com/prashanthNair/gildedRose-Refactoring-Kata.git and open the csharp.sln in Visual Studio then run the test to check the application status
 Expected Behavior: All the test cases should pass except one( that is intended)
 
 Implementation Contains existing code refactoring with the proper test suite, implemented core function for scaling futures and simple way to maintain and bug fixes.

 Consider object oriented programming core principles such as polymorphism, abstraction, inheritance, and factory pattern and also consider SOLID, and DRY principles.
